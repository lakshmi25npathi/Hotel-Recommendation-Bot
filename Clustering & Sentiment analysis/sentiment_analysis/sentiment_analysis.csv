For the order, they brought in a plate filled with string hoppers and varieties of sambars and coconut chutneys as accompaniments. The flavor was decent. We also saw people enjoying vadas as well. The dosa was crispy and tasted as expected. My only qualm was that the serves use their bare hands in touching the food, placing the items on the plate, count how many we had etc which I think should be avoided.

Dispite this being a really local, cheap eating house, the waiters know the words we (foreigners) need to convey, like ""not spicy"", ""drink"" etc. There are pictures of all else fails. \nThe system is after you...order your basic carbs, your table is given the veg/sauces/pastes and other ""things"" you may like to try. Help yourself to the sauces. If you don\'t eat the extra things, you don\'t pay, so don\'t touch, as they go back into stock. \nSo the carbs are, the big paper dosas (thin large pancakes), string hoppers, nan bread and other versions of carbs. It\'s fun dipping and trying all options as a group. Don\'t forget the upstairs area. The restaurant is fast-paced and if you eat slowly and like to people watch you could (descretly) observe many families eat and run.

62,b'Great food; mediocre atmosphere',"b'Reviewed September 21, 2020 '",b'Date of visit: September 2020',"[b'This was my first trip to Navratna at the Taj.  I was a little taken aback by the relative \xe2\x80\x9ctiredness\xe2\x80\x9d of the place.  It lacked the oomph and character one associates with fine dining eateries, especially those located at 5 star hotels.  Below is my...feedback:\nTHE GOOD STUFF:\n-The food definitely!  It more than made up for the delayed service and was absolutely, scrumptiously authentic.  Made me feel quite nostalgic - like i was sitting at a restaurant in Lahore and enjoying the chicken qorma and the garlic naans.\n-The staff was pleasant and well trained on the menu offering.  They quite expertly navigated the newbies on the subtle differences between something like a chicken qorma and a butter chicken; while also knowing and being able to refer the restaurant favourites.\n-The manager Mr. Sisira, a long time denizen of the place, added a lovely, homely quality to the experience with his personal acknowledgements and requests for overall feedback.\nOPPORTUNITIES FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n-The atmosphere definitely! It was very reminiscent of a cafeteria with its brash white lighting and dated decor.  We found some aesthetic reprieve in looking at the adjoining premises which belonged to another Taj restaurant (The Crab Factory) and which were beautifully lit up.\n-The music was dated: Old, sad songs from Hindi films of yesteryear.  While i understand the need to keep the piped music low key and in the background, instilling some zest and character to it will go a long way in notching up the overall atmospheric experience.  Some suggestions: the remakes of old Hindi and Urdu folk songs from \xe2\x80\x9cCoke Studio\xe2\x80\x9d.    \nAll in all, i would definitely recommend the Navratna for its fabulous food.  But as the premises currently stand, it\xe2\x80\x99s a better deal to order in or take away from them rather than dining in.More']",Navratna,POSITIVE

It was nice to visit this location, since we had come for their Sunday brunch before the lockdown.So, we decided to...visit Navaratna since there was a 25% discount on a credit card and we have wanted to have some vegetarian food. After all, no does vegetarian food as well as the Indians The entrance to the hotel was inconvenient since due to CV19 regulations, there was no valet parking. Having to park your car some distance away and walk wasn\'t fun. In fact, it was raining heavily after lunch which ended with me having to get wet in collecting the car. Nothing the hotel can do about this but there needs to be some solution, especially when it rains! Service at the restaurant was prompt and even though it was a Saturday lunch, the restaurant was very empty. Usually its full but this is CV19 for you. The waiter was very knowledgeable about the menu and made valuable recommendations. Sadly, there was too long a wait between the entree and the main meal. Also, we ordered a cheese naan for our kids, which was very late due to it being burnt  therefore, it needed to be redone. Sadly, the delay resulted in the kids eating our naans and negating the need for the cheese naan.\n\nThe food was tasty without being overly exceptional but Navaratna has always been known for its good food.\n\nThe reason I\'m rating the restaurant as being average is that theres another Indian restaurant, down the road, in another 5 star hotel and when one compares the prices paid there and the Navaratna, I\'m sorry to say it does not justify the higher price. My wife had been at lunch at the other Indian restaurant and paid half of what we paid at Navaratna. Whilst the service and the food was good, at the end, the price matters when you do your post purchase evaluation. Overall, I don\'t think I\'ll be back here soon since there\'s an equally good Indian restaurant available a few feet away and with much lower prices.More']",Navratna,NEGATIVE

An amazing international cellar, though many were teetotallers that evening.

I expected the lobster to be sourced locally and to have had more of it in the dish. However it could be imported as were many of the prime ingredients of the mains.\nThe Beetroot Gnocchi was beautiful visually in the rectangles of ruby-ness with the contrasting green of the Rocket, floating in the delicious Gorgonzola creaminess. Pity the promised Chillie Walnuts were down to only a few chips of nut, as I had looked forward to the contrast texture of toasty nuts through the welcome dense-ness of the rest. Nevertheless a pleasing, delicious dish.\nThe Passionfruit and a Chillie Ice cream hit the spot, just the right heat and cold and crunch of seeds.

So there is no big issue when it comes to convenience There is nothing bad about the attitude of staff. The lady who served us always had a smile on her face and even thanked us when we were about to leave. However there was a gent who served us too. He too was polite but got us a dish which we never ordered and said that it was a 'compliment'. This made us happy at that moment and when we were about to eat it he came close and said that it was served by mistake.( He did apologize however) True enough that it is a human error. However, we expect a much more extraordinary customer service from a fine dining restaurant located in CCC. Time taken to prepare food  30 mins average which was good. However there were very less customers at this time Score Home delivery options -- Can be delivered to locations supported by Uber eats  Billing and checkout - Good. Credit/Debit cards accepted. Recommend to have some decent Japanese cuisine. Portions are good however slightly pricy which I think is normal for all Japanese Restaurants in Sri LaMore""]",Edo Japanese Restaurant,POSITIVE

After spending 4 minutes on the menu, I ordered a pork Fried Rice. Yes, I was a bit conservative But because I felt they might not do it the usual way. And I was right. It was a nice and spicy pork curry with a thick gravy on the side of a non-typical serving of fried rice. I loved it! I didnt have desert but had the condensed milk tea. That was an absolute treat. Im a tea person and I love a good cup of Kade the. And I knew the tea was going to be good. My hunch was right again. They served the tinkiri-tea in a typical tea glass its a cash only place.The menu board said the card machine is on leave and Fidel Castro had said pay with cash and fund the revolution. Atleast that's what the Menu Board had mentioned about Castrols take on cash. As you can see, the place has got some humour to light up the curious mind. I usually pay anywhere with my debit-card and get all annoyed if a place doesn't accept cards. But I had seen the cash only sign yesterday. Although I would usually write off a place like that, it was that instant connection that got me thinking that I must visit the place today. So don't mind the cash only policy. After all, good things dont always come only at your convenience! The prices are reasonable and you need to make a few visits to sample all the food. The the roas paan with pol-sambol & cheese should be a winner. I didn\'t have that, but I can vouch that its a hit. Oh, I think they toss an egg onto it too. There are a few more variants of the roas paan. There are many more dishes with twists and turns and I have a feeling they will all live upto expectations. They say the best places have to be found.Halo Diner is not going to wave at you from a distance. Get on to Sea Avenue in Kolpetty and look for it. If you see a Bunky Monkey board, it's just there.

The ambiance is hot, sweaty, and not too clean. Used to be a good place for a eat out. But now it's becoming worse. I came from Moratuwa with my Indian Clients for a eat out and i had to leave without eating. There was a air conditioned upstairs but now seems it's closed. It was very warm inside in afternoon with lots of sunshine and fewer fans. There were few people at the restaurant and i sat under a fan with my special clients. Then a waiter came to us and ordered us to go to a other place where theres is no fan and with lot of sunshine. He never said please, never asked can you? He just commanded us. I never want to be such uncomfortable even if they offer free food. This place is completely avoidable. The food as well as service is terrible.

I was offered an alternative location in their loft bar - they offered to give me exclusive use of the bar which, in my opinion, is a huge step to make me happy considering that I am sure the bar generates plenty of revenue for them on a Friday night (which is the day my husband's birthday fell on). I was assured by Kapila that he would make it perfect but being a perfectionist myself, I was of course worried that it would not meet my expectations. I can honestly tell you that I was blown away. Kapila arranged for a huge heart shape balloon covered decoration to be placed behind our table, the food was out of this world - high quality meat cooked to perfection, and the attention to detail (a photo of my husband and I put on the projector screen during dinner, rose petals, candles everywhere, our photo on the menu) and the service was impeccable.

The fish (Just One Piece) was like a hard rubber eraser and just couldn't eat it. I returned the curry...and made a verbal complaint to the manager & requested the chef to come. When I ask him why the fish curry is so bad, I found out they pre-cook and keep fish in the deep freezer and when an order comes heat it up and put gravy and serve it. Chef him self admit the fish curry could be bad since it's being pre-cooked and stored in deep freezer. I do own a luxury villa in Nuwara Eliya and I am aware how things should be done. Even its in Neliya we always cook then and there and NEVER EVER store pre-cooked fish or any kind of food in deep freezer. Food Store being one of the food outlets at Colombo City Centre & being a reputed outlet, it's really bad for you'll to store pre-cooked fish in your deep freezer. It take may be just 5 minutes to cook and serve the guests.

I have always loved their food throughout, the food is 10/10 as always. However in the past few visits I've paid, I've felt that the current outlet they have is too...small to accommodate the huge crowds that visit, furthermore, the food takes a very long time to be prepared as there would be Uber drivers waiting outside and being in a hurry. They also gawk at you when you enjoy your juicy burgers, which makes the experience a tad shabby. Moreover, I've seen that there is usually an overload on the trip-switch system, causing the restaurant to black out every few minutes, this could prove as a major risk in safety as this could be a reason for a huge fire. These have caused my rating to go down by 2 stars however, I do have a suggestion, if two kitchens are maintained, one for the restaurant and a small kitchen, to cater to Uber orders, most of the things I criticized on could be resolved. Overall, the food is great but the probability of you finding a seat, 1/5.

The prawn detox bowl makes you feel healthy to the core. It comes in two sizes and I opted for the small one which was the perfect amount of food for me. The detox bowl comes packed with poached prawns, avocado chunks, mung beans, tomatoes, roasted chick peas, couscous and a mix of greens  When you mix everything up it becomes a deliciously messy bomb which makes you satisfied. I was never really a fan of healthy food but this literally stol my heart as it was  absolutely yummy and filling .The Full Breakfast plate was massive with two sunny side eggs, sausages, chicken ham, avocado chunks, grilled tomatoes, saut mushrooms, black olives and bread. This was a scrumptious, filling meal which was worth the price. The French toast was super fluffy as it was soaked in milk and topped with cream, caramelized apples and a sliced strawberry. The caramelized apple blended so well with the French toast and was simply AMAZING.For drinks we had strawberry chia lemonade and chia lemonade . Both the drinks were super refreshing, delicious and slightly fizzy.The drinks comes with freshly sliced lemon or fresh strawberry along with chia seeds""]",Superfood,POSITIVE

It is conveniently located at the Ramada. Having gotten a craving for Indian food, I decided to give Alhambra a try, and I am glad I did. From the onset the staff were...extremely courteous and attentive. I was swiftly placed at my table, which provided me a great view of the entire restaurant. The interior instantly gives you the feel of India, with a robust aroma of spices in the air...immediately opening the taste buds. \n\nFor starters I ordered the battered fried paneer sticks (cottage cheese) and the vegetable samosas. The paneers was phenomenal, rich in flavor and cooked to perfection. Equally the samosa too was freshly prepared and full of flavor. The portion size was perfect for a table of four. \n\nFor the mains we indulged in two mutton biriyani, an assortment of naan, alhoo gobi (potato and cauliflower in a thick tomato based gravy), chicken tikka, butter chicken and the tandoori prawns. \n\nThe mutton biriyani was served in a small clay pot. At first appearance the portion size looked small but when you start serving, the quantity is way beyond expectations. A very generous quantity of mutton accompanies the biriyani, which was most welcome. 90% of a good biriyani is in the rice that\xe2\x80\x99s used, and Alhambra won that in spades, the pillau rice was fluffy and gave off the most amazing aroma. \n\nSimilarly, the butter chicken and chicken tikka was well prepared. The taste was subtle, and was not overbearing, so much so that it did not diminish the flavor of the biriyani, rather it was complementary. \n\nThe highlight of the meal was the tandoori prawns. At first sight, the quantity and the size of the prawns were eye popping. Having tasted many tandoori dishes, this was by far the best. An absolute must try! \n\nIn conclusion, Alhambra is a good choice for those that are seeking authentic North Indian cuisine.More']",Alhambra,POSITIVE

Excellent meal and the size was perfect for me. I asked for some...extra sauces as well and the orange colour chilli sauce was extremely delicious, and went well with the garlic sauce. Overall a very satisfying and tasty meal.\n\nHowever I ordered a strawberry iced tea and it came with no strawberry flavouring. I asked for more flavouring and then 5 minutes later they came back saying they have no strawberry flavouring so would I like to have peach iced tea instead. I said sure and they took a very long time to bring my iced tea. I had only two bites of my chicken left when my peach iced tea arrived. \nMy brother asked for tomato ketchup and they brought him some kind of chilli ketchup. When we told them we want tomato ketchup and not this sauce they said no sir this is tomato ketchup. We said no its not and then they brought us proper tomato ketchup 5 minutes later. I don't understand why they didn't bring proper ketchup the first time.\nWhen we were done they offered us two free desserts and we went for the sizzling brownie with ice cream.

Since a few things happen, let me explain in a list formate: 1. it took them about 15min to just...take our order. 2. When our order was taken, the table which was not yet cleaned up from the last customer(s) was not re-set for another 30min until we asked them to. 3. The food arrived about 90minutes later, this is probably not the cafe's fault because there was a special menu that night (collaboration with someone else), however when we asked for another bottle of water, no one brought us one until we decided to pack up the rest of our dinner (which was still not ready) and just head home. 4. When we finally did get our food they forgot a few items. The food that night, which again was not the cafes was really terrible but combined with the service it was just a disaster. I have to say, the one thing I did appreciate coming from the service industry is how apologetic the staff were and how they offered us compensation, they followed the industry rules of listening to the customer, apologising to the customer and providing a solution. My review is that the staff CLEARLY  needs training, it just seemed chaotic, but the staff were capable and kind, they are just not guided correctly. Another part which I am a little reluctant to say is that they gave us some dessert to apologise for everything and the deserts were... not good.  Just because of the way the staff handled the apologies I will maybe one day, reluctantly give this place another shot and hopefully, I can update my review.More"", b'Hello Hotelier,\n\nFirstly, I would like to thank you for taking the time to advise of your recent experience at De Vos Cafe.

The one in the picture?... NO. That is actually a popular Chinese dish, something he probably never had. Spicy Schezuan Chicken.

Cocktails at sunset here is a must when visiting Colombo. Unfortunately our most recent visit was very disappointing. We had a couple of drinks (spirits), which are super expensive compared...to almost everywhere else in Colombo. We knew this anyway but came because of the location and we love the old world charm of the hotel. We ordered lunch... a Caesar salad and a cheese and ham panini. Simple food which for a hotel of this stature you would expect would be outstanding. But sadly not. The salad was very small, just a few bits of bacon and no Caesar dressing, merely a few dollops of mayonnaise. The skimpy bit of ham in the panini was quite fatty so I had to cut quite a lot off and although there was quite a lot of cheese the panini was hardly toasted and was cold and pretty tasteless.  The cheese was hard and rubbery. It was served with a tiny tub of cassava chips, (which is the snack that is served anyway with drinks), a pot of mustard and a sad little lettuce leaf, olive and tomato. I expected it to be lovely and oozing and melting and full of flavour. Very disappointing and absolutely not what you expect from a hotel of this calibre and the price.  It\xe2\x80\x99s such a simple thing really to make a meal special and an upgrade from what you\xe2\x80\x99d make at home but this food had no attention or care.

While the place is not so big the interiors are nicely decorated with a very chic touch to it. Right in the middle of the restaurant is the main...bar with all the dining tables surrounding it. While the ambience is great to dine in, the food however was not up to my expectation. As someone who has tried and eaten a lot of Indian food I thought the taste of the food could be better. The restaurant has an interesting menu with a huge variety and the dishes are named after famous Indian cities depending on the ingredients or spices sourced from these cities as the specialty of the dish. For main course we had mutton biriyani which was ok and chur chur rotis and a mutton curry to go with it. The portion sizes were small and the mutton curry had very little mutton in it. I thought the taste of the food was basic too so there\xe2\x80\x99s definitely scope for improvement there. However they also have an interesting cocktail menu from which I tried the memsahib\xe2\x80\x99s pink gin which was good and my husband tried the vodka based Bombay prohibition which was also tasty and refreshing.

For convenience, we chose to dine here on three different occasions and not at the touristy bistros, bars and cafes in the vicinity. \n\nThis fairly large bistro...has four sections within it compromising a Grill & Italian section; a Spice South Asian section; an Arabian section and an Asian Dragon section.\n\nOn our first visit, we chose to have 2 Curry Crabs ( medium sized sea crabs ) that came with six slices of lightly toasted bread per person. It was delicious and the gravy was lovely to dip in and enjoy. It was also not too pricey as compared to a well known but high end crab restaurant catering to high society in Colombo as well as to tourists. The usual crabs served in these restaurants are Lagoon Crabs ( or sometimes known as Mud Crabs )\n\nOn our subsequent visits, we opted to have Chinese Seafood Noodles from the Asian Dragon section. This dish too was surprisingly well done and tasty. I tried the local, well established beer known as Lion Lager. It was enjoyable and the company first began producing the beer way back in 1881. That beer and stout have now penetrated the US market!\n\nOn the service level, this was a bistro that was energetic, the waiters could understand you easily and the wait time was acceptable.

There were very few reviews so I was reluctant to try this place but im glad I did. The restaurant opened 3 months ago and based on the current situation in Sri Lankan, they seem to be hurting for customers.I hope more people will frequent this place, their Ramen was really tasty. To be honest, I have had Ramen all over the world but never had Paitan ramen.  When I looked at the menu, I was confused as to what kind of ramen they were serving.  I am a fan of Tonkotsu and Shoyu ramen. I would say the Paitan broth is similar to Tonkotsu. My wife and I each ordered the Chicken Paitan Spicy Ramen and my daughters split one Chicken Paitan Hamakaze which was plenty of food for them. The spicy ramen I had was delicious and everyone else liked their Ramen as well.  I will go back to this place for sure. I only have one negative thing to say about this place and that is the server only spoke Tamil and even though he said he spoke English, he could not really speak English and we dont understand Tamil. Don get me wrong, I dont have anything against Tamil, we just dont understand it. I had to ask him if there was anyone in the restaurant who spoke English and he went and got someone which was fine.The staff was friendly and the Ramen is good, I hope more people will try this place.The restaurant is really small and has only 3 tables, mentioning that only to let you know if you are planning on taking a lot of people, you will have an issue with seating. See pictures.The bill came to Rs 5150 which is a fair price for good ramen and a few soft drinks and bottle of water.We will be back again, b'Thank you so much for your very kind words to our restaurant.

The Ramen was delicious and the portion size of the bowl was decent. Overall we had a good time there and hope to visit there again without a second thought. A good place to have an authentic Japanese Ramen for a decent price tag. Their corkage free BYOB policy makes it even better. ;)More"", b'Thank you so much for visiting us and providing your warm comments!!!\nWe are very happy you have enjoyed our ""Ramen"" noodle with your favorite beer!!!\nHope to see you soon again at ""HAMAKAZE Colombo""!!!']",RAMEN HAMAKAZE Colombo,POSITIVE

However, last night the buffet wasn't available so we ate a la carte, starting with simple falafels, tabouleh, lebneh, humous and pita...bread.  It was all delicious, with the pita freshly made and just perfectly moist but crisp.  More astonishingly each dish was Rs 300.   We then had main courses that were good.  The wraps were again amazing value.  \n\nThis place is in a time warp, and with the surge of new hotels coming to Colombo I'm sure it'll be refurbished soon.  There was one other table occupied when we went, and the whole experience made one feel rather like the management of the hotel have forgotten this place exists but someone continues to pay the staff to cook and serve to an empty room.   In the meantime it is probably the cheapest good quality meal I know in Colombo.More""]",Sheherazade,POSITIVE

1572,b'Lost In Translation',"b'Reviewed June 19, 2016 '",b'Date of visit: June 2016',"[b""Had high expectations from Sheherazade, given its one of the oldest and most renowned Arabic restaurants in Colombo. \n\nIt was a decent experience, but falls short of the usually good standards set by Galadari. \n\nLimited selection, compared to other buffets. Appetizers and salads were very...good. Main course very limited and one dimensional. Dessert had potential but not quite as good as it should be. \n\nAs for as cuisine, taste goes, its influenced by Arabic cuisine alright, but also has touches of Indian/Continental/Sri Lankan and hence its hard to call it authentic Arabic. And most dissapointing part-whats Arabic food without a mixed grill or shawarma, or kebab. They didnt have any of that, the shawarma they did have were like appetizers cut into small bites. The lack of action stations was another negative of the restaurant. No item was a standout which you ll remember after 3 days. \n\nThe decor, interior, ambience (If it matters to you), is very amateurish. Doesnt give the aura of a high end restaurant which it probably aspires to be. Service is below average, probably because it was packed to capacity. \n\nA rating of 3/5 is quite generous.\n\nSo all in all dissapointing experience. No comparison to Galadari's other buffets and high tea. Sheherazade needs to really amp its menu, cooking style, ambience if it wants to remotely match the standards of Colombo's other buffets. For the time being, if you re really up for Arabic cuisine, head over to Arabian Knights.More""]",Sheherazade,NEGATIVE

What a disappointment it was.  The starters were beautifully displayed but one would expect to see traditional items like Tabbouleh and Fattouche.  Instead, there...were some very ordinary salads and to give it a remote Arabic air, a very insipid Baba Ghannoush and Hommus.  The mains were simply dreadful.  Arabic rice was served with large roasted goat on top of the rice, but there was no cutlery to slice off the meat.  Baked fish was served with only a small spoon to serve.  It meant smashing the fish into pulp to just have a morsel.  The beef was more tough than shoeleather and the food lacked flavour and taste.  One would expect to see much-loved items like Kibbeh or snacks like Samboussek and Fatayer.  There was nothing that oozed of the lovely Arabic spices like Zaatar and Sumac.  To call this buffet an ""Arabic"" one is an insult to the gorgeous cuisine of the Middle East.  Service was simply awful.  Tables got a basket of Arabic bread but having asked for more we were offered it only after settling the bill!  The desserts were simply uninspiring.  The Om Ali was one soggy mess and the rest of the desserts had no Arabic flavours at all.  An attempt at creating a baklava resulted in thick sheets of pastry with a couple of nuts sprinkled in between and doused in sugar syrup.  It was hard to get past any dish and a terrible disappointment.More']",Sheherazade,NEGATIVE

I think we...were on our third round after the pitcher, when we got sent cocktails that were bereft of alcohol. I was still nursing my drink from the previous round. Despite all the ice in it having melted it was still waaaay darker in colour than the round of drinks that were sent out. I complained to the manager and the drinks were replaced, but it seems pretty obvious the bartenders are in the habit of sending out watered down drinks after the third or fourth round in the belief that patrons are too tipsy to notice.\n\nOn top of this a fight broke out on the dance floor at about 12:30 AM and two groups of guys started pummeling each other. The bouncers did nothing and just stood by and watched the fracas without even trying to intervene. We had already settled our tab, so my friend and I left immediately.\n\nAll in all, a terrible experience. If you want watered down drinks and the chance of getting involved in drunken fisticuffs, then certainly visit this joint. Otherwise give it a wide berth. The only redeeming quality was the live-band, which was quite good. But since you can enjoy the music by sitting on the patio, do that without giving these jokers your custom.\n\nI asked the manager, who told me that the place is owned by Kumar Sangakkara and Mahela Jayawardane. These guys are millionaires and their bar serves watered down drinks to cheat us of our hard-earned money. Talk about pathetic. Shame on them.\n\nI am never going back there.

After I demanded from the management who was downstairs they agreed to give me a bill in English. SURPRISE SURPRISE!!!

2367,b'Lacks some attention to detail',"b'Reviewed November 2, 2018 '",b'Date of visit: November 2018',"[b'We decided to try out a few dishes from their menu. \nClassic chicken philly (picture attached), price was Rs780. \nThe portion was decent and fries included, but lacked the signature chicken philly taste perhaps because it didn\xe2\x80\x99t have enough mushroom or saut\xc3\xa9ed onion. The chicken...seemed to be a mix of diced and sliced chicken and that didnt really work. The taste was just ok for what it was, but if you\xe2\x80\x99re after that classic philly taste, you\xe2\x80\x99d be disappointed. \n\nThe Buffalo chicken melt was Rs595, included fries and was a massive disappointment. \nIt was made with old stale bread, didn\xe2\x80\x99t even have a hint of the \xe2\x80\x9cbuffalo\xe2\x80\x9d flavor. And, the whole point of a \xe2\x80\x9cmelt\xe2\x80\x9d sandwich is to have melted cheese in the sandwich, this had NO cheese, it was unbelievably low in quality and doesn\xe2\x80\x99t live up to its name. \n\nThe Fried chicken sandwich was Rs430 did not include fries, not sure why. \nIt was in the form of a burger and tasted pretty good. It comes in two sizes, perhaps the double would have been better as the portion size of what we ordered was small. \n\nThe ambiance as always was pretty consistent of a classic American diner with music playing off a jukebox. The staff are friendly and attentive. \nThe food lacks attention to detail and if you list the menu with classic food labels (I.e. melts, philly, Buffalo) the food preparation MUST live up to it, you can\xe2\x80\x99t name things just for the sake of it.More']",The Sandwich Factory,NEGATIVE

They also have good quality wine glasses to serve your wine. Sooriya Village and Arcadia fail miserably on that count. \n\nThey are also very  eco friendly. No plastics. Paper straws and glass bottles for water etc. That's another reason to patronize them. The prices on the menu are absolutely honest and they are the prices you pay. There are no add-ons. Therefore when you see the menu you may think that the prices are high but they are not because the sly 30% add on isn't there at Kami Maki. And the portions are generous and larger than at other places.\n\nIts a small place and there is absolutely no Japanese feel to the place.

The drinks too are reasonably priced and i would recommend that you visit the place during their food festivals.

The buttery shrimp was just bland fried shrimp. No taste. Not buttery. And the chicken was just a few sliced chunks of chicken.  Nothing special at all. \n\nMy rack of bacon topped ribs looked nice but arrived COLD.  I don\xe2\x80\x99t mean warm like room temperature I mean cold like they were precooked and tossed in an oven for two minutes.  At least the fries were hot. I called the waiter asked him to touch the ribs.  He wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t. Took them away and came back with a new plate of food about ten minutes later.  They were served with the smallest portion of cole slaw I ever saw in my life.  And the worst tasting dipping sauce. I have no idea what flavor it was but not good.  At least the replacement dish was hotter and the meat came off the bone pretty easily.  \n\nAlso had a loaded bake potato skins side that was basically a sliced bake potato with some bacon and a small dish of sour cream.  \n\nOverall this TGIF doesn\xe2\x80\x99t meet the standards for food service as a US based concept.

The members of the Chinese family who own this place are very friendly.

However, even those waiters didn't smile much, they will offer you a great service.\n\nThere are plenty of variations in the menu which are very affordable. You can ask the option of the owners if you are clueless (Like Me) on what to order. The quantities were ample and the food is yummy yummy.\n\nIf you are a Chinese out of many who  lives and visits Colombo, this is the best escape for you.

We were a little thrown off by not finding the flower shop that everyone was talking about. Turns out the flower shop closed down a week before our visit and has been...replaced with a nightclub. So it's divided into 2 spaces - food and cocktails one side and nightclub on the other. The cocktails are absolutely outstanding - very creative and 11/10 for presentation - this is how it should be done. The food was delicious although I personally struggled with the heat level - not many options for those who can't handle hot spice. The decor in this place is just fantastic - the nicest bathroom in the whole of Sri Lanka for sure. Make sure you try a Loco for Coco cocktail and Murder on the Shanghai Express also fabulous. My friend ordered a Where's Wally Bastion - also fantastic. Then I dragged my 2 reluctant girlfriends to the brand new nightclub side. The DJ really knew how to mix but unfortunately had the music turned up to where the speakers were crackling - those lovely new speakers are in serious threat of being blown apart. His choice was also questionable - I love hip hop/rap - but please play quality artists. I made a request and then he did a whole mix of danceable music - left happy after a good workout on the dance floor.  Hopefully a good scene develops here with a mix of ages and not just the young vacuous things that hang around like decor.

Otherwise it would be real disaster (But I should say that person is doing his best). Sometimes he goes missing for sometime. So we had to wait for some time to ask for the bill after finish eating, until he appears. Another family had to wait for about 10 minutes to get a place to sit, just because there was no one at the reception.\n\nWhen I receive the bill, I was told that they can't accept credit cards for the day.  They have a notice saying they accept credit cards, further I was not informed about this at the reception. Lucky I had some money in hand, but I saw another gentleman went out to search for an ATM.\n\nAnother thing was, there were four pieces of Cheese left in Paneer 65, so we asked to pack them to go.

Only the Mongolian rice stood out while the roasted chicken pasta was bland and poorly presented, noodles with mutton too oily (they were out of pork and mutton so got beef as a replacement), grilled veg panini and the RnR gourmet burger both of which did not impress my friends. They were out of fries as well. To put it simply very average food.\n\nThe starters - hot butter cuttlefish was tasteless, deviled chicken was ok but full of bones, omelet roll which was ok again.\n\nThey don't have a liquor license as of now so we ended up with coca cola which was ridiculously priced at 200 bucks for a normally 30 rupee bottle. \n\nService was meh... Although a manager came out to apologize for the wrong veg dish and they all trooped into bid goodbyes when we were leaving. \n\nThe only good thing was the free pool table which unfortunately is positioned near a wall which makes playing from that side impossible. \n\nThe staff tried to play some music over the sound system but it ended up in a very crackly sound.

Very nice atmosphere and a very good place for a romantic dinner. Food: We had an appetizer of cheesy mushroom which was a delight and it is a great way to kick off dinner since it was mouth watering but not too filling.The Italian food served here is extremely good and of top quality standards. There was a slight mix up with one of the dishes that we ordered but they quickly corrected this very quickly. They also asked and took the correct dish aside so that it was kept warm when both were brought back. I had a seafood risotto and this was a beautifully made dish and everything complimented each other extremely well. We also got a vegetarian risotto as well and this again was made extremely well. Even myself who likes a bit of protein in my meal would have been very happy with the dish. There is one complaint with the food however, which I hope the management will correct. In the seafood risotto, the crab meat, while extremely tasty was not taken out of the shell. In a fine dining restaurant, trying to dig around and break crab shells to get at the meat is not something I want to do and it is something I expected to have been done in the kitchen. As a result I was only able to enjoy a very little of the crab meat since I couldn't dig out or break out the rest. Drinks:They have a lovely variety of mocktails and  juices I cannot remember the name but the drinks we had were very nice. Desert Since it was a birthday, I have called ahead and asked them to set up a cake dish with happy birthday. They brought a special chocolate cake type desert served with a side of ice cream and it was magnificent. Staff: the wait staff are extremely nice and helpful, they have a good knowledge of the kitchen's menu and what can be made and are very helpful in telling you what is good to eat. Conclusion: This is a great restaurant especially for special occasions and romantic dinners.

It seems to be always full of Chinese customers; I guess this is a good sign.\n\nI tried the...chicken fried rice, tempura prawns, dried beef noodles, and a dish with beef with bell peppers and onions. And orange juice for the drink. Now let's go for the details...\n\nThe good: the food is really good. The portions are big. The prices are good too. I could eat that dry beef noodles every week. But the prawns were the real deal! They're fresh and crispy. And the side sauce is simply the best sweet and sour sauce I've ever had! Another nice thing: they served me some fresh fruits after I finished my plate (on the house!).\n\nThe bad: the orange juice wasn't good. Maybe there was a bad orange in it. It tasted funny. The service was ok, but a bit too slow (hint: not the place to go if you are in a hurry). The menu needs improvements. They tried to make it fancy using ipads instead of paper menus. But it's confusing, specially because it's in Chinese characters.\n\nThe ugly: when I finished my dessert (fresh fruits), as I was waiting for the check, one of the servers came to the table and asked me to wait for the check somewhere else as he was in need of the table.

Most people might get confused trying to find the restaurant as it is in the lobby within the Sri Lankan restaurant in an enclosed area. In other words it is a restaurant inside another restaurant. \n\nI visited...with low expectations but was highly impressed. If you are ordering drinks order the sweet Lassi (made with curd) and do not order any of the natural fruit juices as they are very watery and not thick. \n\nThe main dish here is the Thali for lunch / dinner and you can chose either vegetarian / chicken / fish / prawn or mutton. This was the first time I ever ate a Thali and was clueless so here goes. It is a big dish with rice in the middle and curries in small bowls all around. You need to start off with the Rasam. It is like a spicy soup which is an appetizer and is one of the bowls in the Thali. Also before you start eating, wait til they bring you a bowl of hot (Warm) and crispy Naan rotti which is part of the Thali. I made a mistake of eating the rice before and not having any space in the stomach for the Naan rotti. In one of the bowls there is curd which I though was the dessert but its actually there to mix with the rice and eat to get the flavor. All the accompanying curries were nice and spicy with spices to add flavor. Once I finished I was served dessert which I did not know was part of the main Thali that I ordered.\n\nThe staff are very friendly, especially the supervisor who I think is a person called Mr. Rajapaksha (not sure). Overall this is a value for money restaurant because the Thali for Rs. 750/- + taxes was fully worth the money but I sadly wish that I had know earlier what goes into a Thali, for example that I will be served dessert as well and Naan rotti so that I could have enjoyed my meal in a better way.More']",Flavors,NEGATIVE

3397,b'Colombo Fort Harbour Stop verry butyfull',"b'Reviewed April 27, 2017 '",b'Date of visit: April 2017',"[b""Known as Kolonthota, the area became notable as the site of the first landings of the Portuguese in the early 16th century and became one of their trading posts in the island. The Portuguese developed their trading post into a fortified base and harbour to...extend their control of the interior of the island. The fort constructed by the Portuguese was conquered by the Dutch in 1656 and was used to protect their prosperous trading of resources. With Colombo gaining prominence as the center for Dutch administration in the island it was expanded to protect against both the sea and the interior of the island. The Dutch demolished part of the Portuguese-built fortification and reconstructed it to take advantage of the natural strength of the location between a lake and the sea. Due to the conflicts between the Dutch and the Sinhalese kings of the interior, the fort was a major military base as it came under siege on several occasions.Although the ramparts were taken down the area remained to be called the fort. Many buildings in the fort area were home to the British administration of the island and as more legislative power was given to the Ceylonese, it became the site of the Legislative Council and the State Council. As well as the heart of the administrative capital, the fort area became the heart of the commercial capital too. Following independence much of the center of government was centered in this area. However, with the expansion of the government administration, in 1980s the government began to move government ministries and departments to Sri Jayawardenapura Kotte. This began with the shifting of Parliament from the old State Council Building to a new complex in Sri Jayawardenapura. The full shift of government was never completed, as many important government institutions still remain there.\n\nFew remains of the fort and its ramparts remain to this day. Three parts of the ramparts remain. This includes the Delft Gate, located within the Commercial House along Bristol Street.[4] A building dating back to the fort which had been used as a warehouse and a magazine currently houses the Colombo Maritime Museum. Within the grounds of the Colombo port a section of the ramparts remain.[5]\n\nThe fort area is a mixture of buildings from many eras of the cities past. The most notable of residences of the fort is the President's House, official residence of the President of Sri Lanka, next to the Gordon Gardens which was once open to the public is now part of the President's House.""]",Harbour Stop,NEGATIVE

This guest house had only 3 rooms,a...very down to  earth accommodation.One large room  upstairs and two rooms down stairs. It had a truly village atmosphere with a fantastic view of the dam. Rooms though little cramped up were good enough for a day's stay.Though the the toilets were clean but it had no bath cubicles thus making the area wet. The guest house was run by a family whose attitude towards the guests was inviting. As we were vegetarians they made an all out effort to give us satisfactory vegetarian meals. Lunch, Dinner and and Breakfast the following morning. The approach to the guest house from the road by means of carved out Steps which was rather difficult to climb up and down especially for the elderly. However the children enjoyed it. There was no bar as such, but the owners were in a position to purchase beer and Arrack from the wine shop near by. The need to purchase  liquor  did not arise as we had our own stocks. The evening was very nice and cool and were were able do a stroll . The environment with the Dam was awesome. From the guest house you could visit devon falls, St.Clair's falls which is under 15 kilometers.. A very good place to rest and while away the time peace fully.But sophisticated travelers may not like the guest house as the environment  inside the building was not attractive. While we were there a foreign couple fairly elderly arrived by Van. The owner of the guest house went all the way to the Katunayake Airport and picked them up thus making your journey safe in an unknown place. All in all the guest house was passable but rather dull.. It may be good for honeymoon couples who may like to spend their time  undisturbed. A change from the usual guest houses in Srilanka.. The owners indicated to us that they are making arrangements to refurbish and  make the steps  approachable with ease to reach the guest house.

The Thai style garoupa full fried fish was bathed in what was claimed to be Thai sauce. It looked more like used engine oil and the fish was buried in it. The same sauce was used for Chicken and Cashew nut. It was so mushy and unpalatable. For four persons it cost over Sri Lankan rupees 15,000 or just US $ 150 for four persons including myself.

One of the owners was also there...and he made every effort to make sure I enjoyed my dining experience.\n\nI ordered the Caesar Salad for a starter. I was not prepared for 1) The show where they make it in front of you! And 2) The complete, utter delicious freshness and crunch in every bite! I could taste the nature, if that makes lol. Yummm.\n\nFor a mains, I ordered what was essentially a gorgeously succulent jumbo prawn on a bed of veggies, drizzled with butter. Every mouthful was sinfully delicious. \n\nDessert was a blueberry panna cotta that was just the right amount of berry tang and super sweet cream, with a light crunch of crumbled cookie.\n\nAnd the lattes. Oh my sweet caffeine heaven, the lattes. Let me just say it was so good that I had two. Sleep was a welcome sacrifice that night! #WorthIt.\n\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll totally be back. A bit pricey but so dang worth it. \n\nTIP: sit out in the garden out back. It\xe2\x80\x99s a beautifully intimate setting with pretty fairy lights that light up the trees.

3443,"b'A strange place - located in very dark road, poor service and MASSIVE upselling'","b'Reviewed February 22, 2020 '",b'Date of visit: February 2020',"[b'A strange place - located in a dark unlit side-road 2 blocks behind the beach and we were continuously followed by tuk-tuks and walkers so wasn\'t a good start. Got inside and we sat in rear garden which has a nice ambience. However, upon being...seated we were then totally ignored - to the extent that the candle was unlit and only one place setting was left on the table. When we did get to order we ordered Asian food circa Rp2,000 per very small plate but the waiter virtually insisted we should order the ""Peterhouse"" steak (obviously meant porterhouse) at Rp18,000 EACH! That\'s \xc2\xa375 / $100USD each for a basic steak and the prices went up steeply from there. There seemed to be a few groups on business in there who clearly surmised that their expenses would cover it but we ate our (nice) starters plus a shared dessert, paid and left.., service was so lack-lustre for us mainly due to the fuss being made of anyone who (for whatever reason) paid a lot of money for imported AUS beef! \nNo need to bother really - there are plenty of good restaurants on main road without risking life & limb to go here.More']",The Avenue,NEGATIVE

People who don't know about real tacos may really come and eat at this crappy place. Unfortunately for us, the soft tacos did not have chunks of tomatoes and grated cheese on it. The taco sauce was not even visible to ones bare eyes. The small sauce packets were given one per person. Then the loaded nachos was NOT LOADED at all. It barely had anything on it. Then the little cup that had melted nacho cheese was less than quarter of it filled. To make things worse, my friend ordered a chocodila which had no more than a quarter teaspoon of chocolate applied on it. What the hell are these people thinking...?
